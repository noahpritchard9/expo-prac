      <h2>About</h2>
      <div>
        Cities demonstrate the growth and history of human achievement
        throughout time. Historical sites and neighborhoods develop over
        decades, leaving plenty of places to explore. For both locals and
        visitors alike, reliance on different sources of information to plan an
        excursion are necessary. Journey simultaneously looks to give the least
        researched tourist and most seasoned local the resources in order to
        explore their area. Journey provides users with personalized walking
        routes, tailored to their wants and needs, for an end result of a
        comfortable, enjoyable, and educational outing into their destination.
        In practice, Journey gives users a route to walk around their area based
        upon the preferences that they set within the app. This way, each user
        is given a tailored experience to enjoy their excursion as they see fit.
        The route is generated around the userâ€™s current location and returns
        them back to their starting position, encapsulating their entire journey
        with just a single query.
